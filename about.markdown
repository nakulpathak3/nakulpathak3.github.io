Hi, I'm Nakul. I work out of Toronto at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/) where I'm working on Sidekiq, Terraform-ing AWS Fargate, Ruby and Rails upgrades and whatever else comes my way.

Before Scribd, I went to the University of Waterloo for Software Engineering and interned at companies like Twitter, Apple, Shopify, SigOpt, and Oracle.

I enjoy the same things every software engineer does - hiking, biking, beer, and coffee :) Thankfully, I have not taken up rock climbing.
